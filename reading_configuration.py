In the following task you will need to do two things: 
    
1) Indicate if a sentence makes sense.
2) Memorize the letters that appear after each sentence.

Read each sentence aloud as soon as you can. 
Press the C key (for correct) if the sentence makes sense, or press the I key (for incorrect) if the sentence does not make sense.

After each sentence, a letter that we want you to memorize will appear. 
Please read the letter aloud and memorize it. 

After a certain number of items, a question mark will appear on the screen. 
At that point you will need to type in the list of letters in the order that you read them. For example 'h w k j'.

Press the space bar to continue"""

Before the experiment starts, you will be doing some practice problems. 

During the practice problems, you will be told if you answered accurately or not.

Your task is to remember these letters until you are prompted with a question mark to enter them in the correct order.

Make sure to separate the characters with spaces ('h w k j'), and press "Enter" when you're done. 

Please make sure your answer is correct before hitting Enter. You can make corrections using the arrow keys. Feel free to use upper or lower case in your answers.
